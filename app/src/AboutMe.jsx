                Hello! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and minoring in Mathematics.
                I'm excited to be starting my first co-op at Toast in the coming months.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in a small town just north of London, and since starting at Northeastern in Fall 2023, Iâ€™ve been based in Boston.
            </p>
            <p> I am super interested in the Theme Park Industy specifically the intersection between Computer Science and this industy.
              I am also passionate about Computer Science in Education and getting young kids involved in all STEM subjects.
